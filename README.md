Gaining Insights from the kaggle titanic dataset

The aim of this project is to gain in depth insights from the titanic dataset (available on Kaggle). We cover the three categories of feature learning approaches, and compare metrics:
1. Fixed-shape universal approximators (kernel methods) 
2. Neural network based universal approximators 
3. Tree-based approaches
